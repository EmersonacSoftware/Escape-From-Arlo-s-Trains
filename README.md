{[--={ ACCESSING THE WEBPAGE }=--]}
Accessing the webpage is as simple as writing the link in your search engine/browser of choice.
From there you can click ENTER and play EFAT.

{[--={ RUNNING THE GAME }=--]}
The game will be situated on the bottom of the page. It will start automatically. Enjoy!

{[--={ GAME AT A GLANCE }=--]}
The game will open with an intro, because everyone needs to have a kickass sexy intro. Right?
After that, you will be on the main screen. Use W and S to navigate the menu, then press SPACE to select.
From there, you may select the levels, configure your spacecraft and check your achievements.
I won't spoil anything else, so go and play and discover the game yourself!

{[--={ WORDS THAT ARLO HATES }=--]}
Did Arlo hack your PC? No worries!
The program/website is embedded with words that Arlo hates. It's basically an AntiArlo antivirus!

WORDS EMBEDDED IN THE .EXE:
- Retard
- Bitch
- Idiot
- Trump
- MAGA (Make America Great Again)
- FJB (Fack Joe Biden)
- LGB (Let's Go Brandon [NOT the G Scale Model Train brand!])
- Emersonac (Arlo HATES it!)
- Mark the HO Scale Engine

And a few others like the N word. Lmao.
(LEGAL DISCLAIMER: ES/Emersonac Interactive HAS NOT embedded the N-word in the program.)
